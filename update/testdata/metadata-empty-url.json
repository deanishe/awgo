The default, \"mosh\", should work on most systems, as the command is passed to your terminal application.\n\nTo disable mosh, delete the value for MOSH_CMD.\n\nThe SSH_CMD performs a similar function for the default action (opening SSH connections).\n\nBy default, the workflow generates an ssh://... URL and asks the system to open it (or passes it to the application specified in SSH_APP).\n\nIf you set SSH_CMD, the workflow will instead generate an `ssh` command and run that in your Terminal app. This is slower, but\nwill load your dotfiles.\n\nSet EXIT_ON_SUCCESS to 0 to prevent the terminal closing if the ping/mosh command exits cleanly.\n\n\nWhen removing a connection from the History, the workflow re-opens itself with the previous query.\n\nThe EXTERNAL_TRIGGER setting tells the workflow to re-open itself using the External Trigger instead of calling itself by keyword (\"ssh\").",
