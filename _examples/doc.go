Package examples contains trivial, but complete, Alfred workflows
demonstrating features of AwGo and/or useful workflow idioms.

After building the executable, copy or symlink the directory to Alfred's
workflow directory to try it out.

You can use the following script to simplify installing/symlinking
workflows that are still in development:

https://gist.github.com/deanishe/35faae3e7f89f629a94e

If you've installed that script on your $PATH, you can try out the
examples by running:

	workflow-install -s /path/to/example/workflow

which will symlink the workflow to Alfred's workflow directory.
