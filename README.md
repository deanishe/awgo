Full-featured library to build lightning-fast workflows in a jiffy.

Features
--------

- Easy access to [Alfred and workflow settings][config].
- Fluent API for generating [Alfred JSON feedback][feedback] for Script Filters.
- Support for all applicable Alfred features up to v3.6.
- [Fuzzy sorting/filtering][fuzzy] of results.
- [Simple, but powerful, API][cache-api] for [caching/saving workflow data][cache].
- [Catches panics, logs stack trace and shows user an error message][run].
- Workflow [update API][update] with built-in support for [GitHub releases][update-github].
- [Pre-configured logging][logging] for easier debugging, with a rotated log file.
- ["Magic" queries/actions][magic] for simplified development and user support.
- macOS [system icons][icons].


Installation & usage
--------------------

Install AwGo with:

```sh
go get -u github.com/deanishe/awgo
```

Typically, you'd call your program's main entry point via `Workflow.Run()`.
This way, the library will rescue any panic, log the stack trace and show
an error message to the user in Alfred.

program.go:

```go
package main

// Package is called aw
import "github.com/deanishe/awgo"

// Workflow is the main API
var wf *aw.Workflow

func init() {
    // Create a new Workflow using default settings.
    // Critical settings are provided by Alfred via environment variables,
    // so this *will* die in flames if not run in an Alfred-like environment.
    wf = aw.New()
}

// Your workflow starts here
func run() {
    // Add a "Script Filter" result
    wf.NewItem("First result!")
    // Send results to Alfred
    wf.SendFeedback()
}

func main() {
    // Wrap your entry point with Run() to catch and log panics and
    // show an error in Alfred instead of silently dying
    wf.Run(run)
}
```

In the Script Filter's Script box (Language = /bin/bash with input as
argv):

```sh
./program "$1"
```


Documentation
-------------

Read the docs [on GoDoc][godoc].

Check out the [example workflows][examples-code] ([docs][examples-docs]), which
show how to use AwGo. Use one as a template to get your own workflow up and
running quickly.


Running/testing
---------------

The library, and therefore the unit tests, rely on being run in an Alfred-like
environment, as they pull configuration options from environment variables
(which are set by Alfred).

As such, you must `source` the `env.sh` script in the project root or run unit
tests via the `run-tests.sh` script (which also sets up an appropriate
environment before calling `go test`).
